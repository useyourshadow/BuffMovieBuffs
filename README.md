## Description

This project generates random mazes and shows visually how different maze traversal algorithms (BFS and DFS) arrive at the solution.

---

## Features


- DFS-and-carve algorithm generates a new random maze with each run of the program
- Maze is a square grid - user can choose the size in the terminal
- Visualization shows the difference between BFS and DFS algorithms
- Timers show how long each algorithm takes to arrive at the path
- Reset button allows user to generate new maze without having to restart the program

## Use
User must have Python and PyGame installed to run this. Download main.py and navigate to the folder it is in. Run 'python main.py' in the command line.
